      <h2>Repair Terms & Conditions</h2>
      <p><strong>Last Updated: May 7, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions govern the repair services ("Services") provided by CompNet ("Company", "we", "us", "our") to you ("Customer", "you").</p>
      
      <h3>1. Service Authorisation and Estimates</h3>
      <p>Upon bringing your device for repair, we will perform an initial diagnosis. A non-refundable diagnostic fee may be charged for this service, which will typically be credited towards the final repair cost if you choose to proceed. We will provide you with an estimate for the repair. This estimate is not a guaranteed price and may change if further issues are discovered during the repair process. We will seek your approval for any additional charges before proceeding.</p>

      <h3>2. Turnaround Time</h3>
      <p>We will make reasonable efforts to complete repairs within the estimated timeframe. However, turnaround times are estimates and are not guaranteed, as delays may occur due to parts availability or unforeseen complexities. We will keep you informed of any significant delays.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Customer Data</h3>
      <p>It is your responsibility to back up all data on your device(s) before submitting them for repair. While we take utmost care, CompNet is not responsible for any loss, corruption, or breach of data that may occur during the repair process. We may need to perform a factory reset or software reinstallation, which will erase all data. We strongly recommend you back up your data prior to service.</p>

      <h3>4. Warranty</h3>
      <p>We offer a 90-day warranty on parts replaced and labour performed for the specific repair conducted. This warranty does not cover new problems unrelated to the original repair, damage caused by misuse, accidents, liquid damage, software issues introduced after the repair, or issues arising from pre-existing conditions not disclosed at the time of service. Warranty is void if the device is opened or tampered with by anyone other than CompNet technicians after our service.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Payment</h3>
      <p>Full payment is due upon completion of the Services and before the repaired device is returned to you. We accept various payment methods, which will be communicated at the time of service. For certain repairs or parts orders, a deposit may be required.</p>
      
      <h3>6. Abandoned Devices</h3>
      <p>Devices left with CompNet for more than 60 days after notification of completion or non-repair (if applicable) without payment or collection arrangements will be considered abandoned. CompNet reserves the right to dispose of or sell abandoned devices to recover costs, without further liability to you.</p>

      <h2>Returns & Refund Policy (for Products Sold)</h2>

      <p>You have 14 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. Your item must be in the original packaging. Your item needs to have the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your original method of payment. You will receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.</p>
      <h3>Shipping</h3>
      <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund if we arrange collection.</p>
      <h3>Exceptions</h3>
      <p>Software, custom-built PCs (once work has commenced with your approval), and special order items may not be eligible for return or may be subject to a restocking fee. This will be communicated at the time of purchase.</p>
